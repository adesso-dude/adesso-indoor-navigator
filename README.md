## Setup

### Step 1 - Clone & install repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adessoAG/adesso-indoor-navigator
npm install
```

### Step 2 - Edit `config.js`
Now you need to configure your project to use your own Viro API key and your own firebase database. Please create a copy of `./configTemplate.js` named `./config.js` and replace the test data with your information.

#### WARNING
The `config.js` is included in the `.gitignore` and will **not** be commited into your git repository. You must keep track of it **on your own**.
